1) head -> It is used to view beginning of the file. Without any instructor (head file.txt), it prints the first 10 lines.
head [OPTION]... [FILE]...

We can display the first n lines like that:
head -n n filename.txt
# n is a natural number.

2) tail -> It is used to view ending of the file. By default, it will display last 10 lines of the file.
tail [OPTION]... [FILE]...

We can display the last n lines like that:
tail -n n filename.txt
# n is a natural number.

3) cp -> This is used to copy files and directories from one location to another. It can copy single or multiple files, and entire directories, depending on the options provided.
cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DESTINATION

SOURCE: The file or directory you want to copy.
DESTINATION: The location where the copy will be saved.

When using the cp command, a new file is created in the destination (if one with the same name does not already exist). The contents of the source file are copied to the newly created file in the destination.


cp file.txt /path/to/destination/
#This copies file.txt to the specified directory.

cp file.txt newfile.txt
# Created newfile.txt and copy file.txt content here 

cp -r /path/to/directory/ /path/to/destination/
#The -r option is necessary to copy directories recursively, including all their contents.

cp fileName.txt .
# It copies fileName.txt to our current directory.
