1) shutdown -> It is used to power off or reboot the system in a controlled manner, allowing users to notify all logged-in users and processes that the system is going down.

To be able to use this command we should have administrative access.

'shutdown' -> Without any argument, it will shut down after one minute.

'shutdown now' -> Shuts down the system immediately.

We can write the message after the command, so when it is shutdowning, the message will appear, like 'shutdown now "GOODBYE"'.

We can specify when shutdowning will happen.
Example:
'shutdown +15'

Shuts down the system in 15 minutes. You can replace 15 with any number of minutes.
We can replace 15 with any number.

We can also special the time like that:
'shutdown 23:00'

Shuts down the system at 11:00 PM.


With each of them, we can use message.


2) date -> It prints current time.
We just need to write 'date'.

3) ifconfig ->
