### **Hypervisors**

#### **Definition** :

A hypervisor, or Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), is software or firmware that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs) by abstracting hardware resources and allocating them to the VMs. It acts as a bridge between the physical hardware and the virtual environments.

### **Types of Hypervisors**

#### **1. Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-metal Hypervisor)**

* **Definition** : Runs directly on the physical hardware without the need for a host operating system. It provides high performance and is commonly used in enterprise environments.
* **Features** :
* Direct access to hardware resources.
* Better performance and efficiency.
* Greater security due to reduced layers.
* **Examples** :
* **VMware ESXi** : Widely used in data centers for server virtualization.
* **Microsoft Hyper-V** : A Windows-based hypervisor for enterprise virtualization.
* **Xen** : Open-source hypervisor used in cloud computing platforms like AWS.

#### **2. Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor)**

* **Definition** : Runs on top of a host operating system and relies on it to manage hardware interactions. It is typically used for personal or development purposes.
* **Features** :
* Easier to set up and use.
* Less performance compared to Type 1 because it depends on the host OS.
* Ideal for testing and development.
* **Examples** :
* **Oracle VirtualBox** : Free, open-source hypervisor used for desktop virtualization.
* **VMware Workstation** : A feature-rich option for desktop virtualization.
* **Parallels Desktop** : Popular for running Windows on macOS systems.

### **Comparison of Type 1 and Type 2 Hypervisors**

| **Feature**     | **Type 1 Hypervisor** | **Type 2 Hypervisor**    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Runs on**     | Directly on hardware        | Host operating system          |
| **Performance** | High                        | Moderate to low                |
| **Use Case**    | Enterprise and production   | Personal or development        |
| **Examples**    | VMware ESXi, Hyper-V, Xen   | VirtualBox, VMware Workstation |

Hypervisors play a crucial role in virtualization by enabling the creation and management of multiple virtual environments, each capable of running its own operating system.
