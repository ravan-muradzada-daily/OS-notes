FAT32 and NTFS are two widely used file systems with distinct features, advantages, and limitations.

 FAT32, which stands for File Allocation Table 32-bit, is an older file system known for its simplicity and compatibility. It supports a maximum file size of 4 GB and a volume size of up to 2 TB, making it suitable for USB drives and small storage devices where cross-platform compatibility is essential. However, FAT32 lacks advanced features such as file permissions, encryption, and journaling, making it less secure and prone to data loss during system crashes. 

On the other hand, NTFS (New Technology File System) is a modern file system optimized for large storage devices like HDDs and SSDs. It supports significantly larger file and volume sizes, advanced features like compression, encryption, and access control, and uses journaling to enhance data integrity. While NTFS is highly efficient for large drives and modern operating systems, its compatibility with older devices and certain systems like gaming consoles or TVs is limited. 

For practical use, FAT32 is ideal for USB drives and smaller storage devices requiring maximum compatibility, while NTFS is the preferred choice for internal drives and scenarios requiring robust security and handling of large files.

EXT4
ExFAT is optimized for flash drives â€” designed to be a lightweight file system like FAT32, but without the extra features and overhead of NTFS and without the limitations of FAT32. The name is short for "Extended File Allocation Table."
