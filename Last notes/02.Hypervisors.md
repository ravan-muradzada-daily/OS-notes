Another name for hypervisors is virtual machine monitor. It is a software that creates and helps to manage vm's. It  helps us to allocate resources for vm's. It acts as a bridge between vm's and physical hardware.

There are two types of hypervisors.

##### Type 1

It runs the directly on a physical hardware without needing for a host os. It provides high security and commonly used in enterprise environments. It can access to hardware resources and be better in performance and efficiency.
Examples:
***VMware ESXI*** - Used in data centers for server virtualization.
***Microsoft Hyper-V*** - A windows-based hypervisor for enterprised virtualization
***Xen*** - open source hypervisor used by platform like AWS.

##### Type 2

It runs on top of OS and relies on it to manage hardware resources. It is used for personal usage and developement. It is much easier to set up it and use. However, it  has less performance, because it is laid on host OS. It is ideal for testing and development.
Examples:
***Oracle VirtualBox*** - Free, open-source hypervisor used for desktop virtualization.
***VMWare Workstations*** - It has rich features for desktop virtualization
***Parallels Desktop*** - Popular for running windows or macos systems.
