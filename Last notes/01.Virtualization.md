It is a virtual version of creating physical hardware, software or network resources. It enables to use multiple operating system or applications to run on a single hardware, physical resource.
It has some adventages:

1. Reducing physical servers
2. CPU, memory and storage efficient usage
3. Testing and development
4. Disaster recovery

There are four main types of virtualization:

1. Server vt - It divides a physical server to multiple virtual servers. It enables better resource usage, management and reduced hardware costs.
2. Desktop vt - It helps to host a destop in a centralized server and then using it via network. We can access it from anywhere, it reduces costs and increase security.
3. Storage vt - It helps to pool multiple physical storage devices in one place. It impoves storage management and resource sharing and scalability.
4. Network vt - It helps us to create networks that operates independently of the underlying hardware. It simplifies network management and isolation of network segments.
