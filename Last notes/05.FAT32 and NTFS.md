FAT32 and NTFS are two widely used file systems with different features, advantages and limitations.

##### FAT32

- File Allocation Table 32-bit
- Older file system
- Maximum file size 4 gb
- Maximum volume 2 TB
- Good for USB and small storage devices
- Lacking from file permissions, encryption
- Less secure and prone to system crashes

##### NTFS

- New Tech File System
- Large storage devices (HDD and SSD)
- Much larger volume and file size
- Possible: file permissions and encryption
- Compability with older devices is low (gaming consoles and TV)
- Good for internal drivers.

For practical use, FAT32 is ideal for USB drives and smaller storage devices requiring maximum compatibility, while NTFS is the preferred choice for internal drives and scenarios requiring robust security and handling of large files.

##### EXT4

- For flash drivers
- Designed for light-weight systems
- Without extra features of NTFS and limitations of FAT32.
